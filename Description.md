First you enter the number of rows that you want, then the number of columns, then the number that you want to search for

The program then asks you to enter the values of the numbers in the array according to the number of rows and columns that you previously entered

Then the program output the number that is need to be searched for , to make it clear for you which number is searched for

If the number exists , a message is shown "will not take number"

If the number doesnot exist , a message is shown "will take number"
